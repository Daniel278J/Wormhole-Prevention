# Wormhole-Prevention
As a team of 3, We studied the Wormhole attack in the MANETS (Wireless networks) in reactive routing protocol AODV. The malicious nodes between the sender and receiver nodes manipulate the metrics to hijack the packets. We modified the AODV protocol to use “Average time per hop” to avoid the wormhole attack.
